# MultiAPI
## A Web scrapping Express.js RESTful API for delivering entertainment data.
#### With the use of Axios and Cheerio libraries, the API fetches different web pages, scraps data and delivers it through various endpoints.<br/>
*For now, the API does not require an API key, but will in the future.

## Supported Endpoints:
#### /api/v1/movies/imdb/top
#### /api/v1/games/imdb/top
#### /api/v/1games/metacritic/top
